# Deploy

The translator bot is a Node app which is designed to run easily on Heroku.

# What If ?

## I had a reaction to a message but the bot doesn't answer.

The bot is a team memer as everyone else so the bot can only post on channel/group that he is invited.
The same for the private tchat the bot is not able to acces to you private conversation if you don't invite him.
